# PCOS Analysis Using Machine Learning

**Application**: [Application Link](#)  <!-- Replace "#" with the actual link to the application -->

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and understand Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) based on various data attributes. The goal is to support early detection and better management of PCOS.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, data Scaling and Feature Selection.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements and compares various algorithms such as Random Forest classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model performance.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays insights from the data using graphs and charts.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn and Imbalanced Learn for machine learning algorithms
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to PCOS such as:
- Demographic information (age, weight, height, etc.)
- Hormonal levels
- Clinical features

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vellankis-space/PCOS.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PCOS
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook PCOS_analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the specified directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the data.
3. Train the model using the provided training script.
4. Evaluate the model on test data and visualize the results.

## Results
- **Model Performance**: Summarize the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report of the best-performing model.

## Applications
This project can be applied in:
- Assisting healthcare professionals with early PCOS diagnosis.
- Enhancing research in PCOS and hormonal disorders.

## Limitations
- The model’s accuracy depends on the quality and size of the dataset.
- Predictions are not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.

## Future Work
- Integration of additional datasets to improve model robustness.
- Implementation of deep learning techniques for enhanced performance.
- Deployment of the model as a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.
